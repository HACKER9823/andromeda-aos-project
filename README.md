## **Project Name: AndroFund**  

**AndroFund** is a **grants platform on the Andromeda blockchain** that enables funding for open-source projects using **ANDR tokens** and **Kepler Wallet** for secure transactions.  

I'm a **Web3 and Web2 developer** building innovative decentralized solutions. 

## **Project Description**  

**AndroFund** is a **grants platform** built on the **Andromeda blockchain** that enables open-source developers to secure funding for their projects. Anyone can **submit a project**, and community members can **fund projects directly** using **ANDR tokens** via **Kepler Wallet**.  

Users can **like projects**, and the most popular ones become **eligible for additional funding** based on community support. To maintain quality, **a spam detection model** filters out duplicate or low-quality submissions.  

By connecting your wallet, you can **submit projects, support innovative ideas, and help shape the future of decentralized technology**. 🚀
## **Vision Statement**  

**AndroFund** is designed to **democratize open-source funding** by providing a **transparent, community-driven grants platform** on the **Andromeda blockchain**. Developers can **secure funding directly** through **ANDR tokens**, while the **Kepler Wallet** ensures safe and seamless transactions.  

The **platform rewards community engagement**, where the most-liked projects get **additional funding opportunities**. A **spam detection model** maintains quality by filtering out duplicate or low-value submissions.  

With a **simple and intuitive UI**, anyone—whether a developer or supporter—can easily navigate the platform, submit projects, or contribute to promising ideas. By making funding **accessible and efficient**, AndroFund helps grow the **Andromeda ecosystem**, fostering **innovation and decentralization**. 🚀
## **Software Development Plan**  

### **1. ADO Smart Contract Development**  
- Develop an **Andromeda Decentralized Object (ADO)** to manage **crowdfunding and staking**.  
- Key variables:  
  - `projectName`, `githubLink`, `description`, `keplerAddress`, `likes`, `fundsRaised`, `stakedAmount`.  
- Essential functions:  
  - `submitProject()`: Developers submit projects for funding.  
  - `fundProject()`: Users contribute **ANDR tokens** to projects.  
  - `stakeTokens()`: Users stake ANDR tokens to show commitment and boost project credibility.  
  - `likeProject()`: Users like projects to increase visibility.  
  - `getTopProjects()`: Fetches the most funded and liked projects.  
  - `withdrawFunds()`: Project owners withdraw raised funds based on milestones.  

### **2. Spam Detection System**  
- AI-powered **spam filter** to block duplicate or low-quality submissions.  

### **3. Intuitive Frontend Development**  
- **Next.js 14 UI** with **Kepler Wallet integration** for authentication and transactions.  
- Display **projects, funding stats, likes, and staking details**.  

### **4. Backend API & Database**  
- **API routes** to interact with ADO for funding, staking, and retrieving project data.  

### **5. Testing & Optimization**  
- **Smart contract testing** for security and correctness.  
- Optimize UI for a **smooth user experience**.  

### **6. Deployment & Launch**  
- Deploy **ADO on Andromeda Devnet/Mainnet**.  
- Launch the platform, enabling **secure crowdfunding, staking, and community-driven project support**. 🚀

I have always been passionate about both **Web3 and Web2 development**, exploring how decentralized technologies can reshape funding and innovation. While working on various blockchain projects, I noticed how **open-source developers struggle to secure funding** despite building impactful solutions. This inspired me to create **AndroFund**, a **simple, community-driven crowdfunding platform** powered by **Andromeda ADOs**. With features like **direct funding, staking, and spam detection**, AndroFund ensures that only **genuine projects** get visibility and support. My goal is to **empower developers** by giving them an easy, transparent way to **connect with funders and grow their ideas into reality**. 🚀
